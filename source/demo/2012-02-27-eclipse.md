A tutorial on [using **knitr** in Eclipse](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/releases/download/doc/knitr-eclipse.pdf) by courtesy of Jenny Hutchison is available for download. It is probably too long for an experienced Eclipse user, and as a person who does not use Eclipse, I believe one screenshot can explain the setup:

You do not have to follow this. For example, you can run `knit()` first to get the tex document, and let Eclipse compile tex to PDF; in the above configuration, the two steps were combined into one `knit2pdf()`. See the post in the blog [Dang, another error](http://danganothererror.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/getting-knitr-to-work-with-statet/) for the alternative way of configuration.

Thanks, Jenny!
