> Update (2014/12/24): the **rmarkdown** package has made this much much easier,
so you should probably ignore this page. Please see
<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a simple demo of making DZslides with **knitr** and [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/):

- Rmd source: [knitr-slides.Rmd](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/009-slides.Rmd)
- markdown output: [knitr-slides.md](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/009-slides.md)

Run the `pandoc` command mentioned in the slides to get the HTML output. Use
Left/Right arrows to navigate through the slides.

Also see slides made by other users in the [showcase](../showcase/) page, e.g. [Gaston Sanchez](http://gastonsanchez.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/creating-html5-slides-with-rstudio-knitr-and-pandoc/).
